 * Script to compute the building closeness to a 50 m wide isolated building ("building_number_building_neighbor" = 0).

 * We use a logistic function to avoid threshold effects (e.g. totally different result for building sizes

 * training data to identify the real size of the buildings classified as larger than 50 m in the
