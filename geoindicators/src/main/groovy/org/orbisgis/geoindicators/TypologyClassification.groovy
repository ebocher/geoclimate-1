/**
 * This process is used to assign to a Reference Spatial Unit (RSU) a Local Climate Zone type (Stewart et Oke, 2012).
 * This assignment is performed according to the 7 indicators used for LCZ classification. Each LCZ type has a
 * given range for each of the 7 indicators. Then the method to find the LCZ type that is the most appropriate for
 * a given RSU is based on the minimum distance to each LCZ (in the 7 dimensions space). In order to calculate this
 * distance, each dimension is normalized according to the mean and the standard deviation (or median and absolute median
 * deviation) of the interval values. Some of the indicators may be more important (or reliable) than the other
 * for the LCZ identification. In order to manage this point, a map containing weights may be passed and will be
 * used to multiply the distance due to a given indicator.
 *
 * @param rsuLczIndicators The table name where are stored ONLY the LCZ indicator values, the RSU id and the RSU geometries
 * @param normalisationType The indicators used for normalisation of the indicators
 *          --> "AVG": the mean and the standard deviation are used
 *          --> "MEDIAN": the median and the mediane absolute deviation are used
 * @param mapOfWeights Values that will be used to increase or decrease the weight of an indicator (which are the key
 * of the map) for the LCZ classification step (default : all values to 1)
 * @param prefixName String use as prefix to name the output table
 * @param datasource A connection to a database
